          <h2>Doug Jones</h2>
          <p>Doug Jones is a product and lifelong resident of Alabama. He was born in Fairfield, Alabama to a father who worked for U.S. Steel and a stay-at-home mom. One of Doug’s grandfathers was a steelworker and the other a coal miner. He, too, spent some time working a union job in the steel mill. His parents and grandparents forged his respect for those who work to feed a family while trying to make their children’s lives better.</p>

<p>Doug attended Fairfield High School during desegregation. As a student and SGA leader, he worked with his classmates to maintain calm and build unity during those tumultuous times.</p>

<p>Through his family, his work in the mill, and his friendships at Fairfield High School, Doug was drawn to study government at Alabama and then law at Cumberland Law School. A career in public service seemed to him the best way to expand justice from the personal to the national level.</p>

<p>After law school, he had the honor of serving as staff counsel to the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee for Senator Howell Heflin. In 1980, Doug became an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Birmingham. For several years, as a prosecutor and then private defense attorney, he developed a deeper understanding of our criminal justice system. Doug served as the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama beginning in 1997. He was nominated by a Democratic President and confirmed by a majority-Republican Senate.</p>

<p>At around this time, the state was reopening a three-decade-old case that had been the most tarnishing crime in Alabama in the 20th century – the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church. The Klan used dynamite to kill four little girls, and three of the four killers had escaped justice for over 35 years. Doug led an incredibly dedicated team of prosecutors, investigators and staff, leading to the conviction of two former Klansmen for the murder of those four innocent children.</p>

<p>Doug Jones ran for Senate in order to be a voice for reason in the turmoil of modern Washington. Now that he’s been elected, he wants to bring the hope of justice and fairness back to all Alabamians. Too many Alabamians don’t believe our government is serving them. The issues that affect our daily lives – healthcare, wages, true equality for all – have become bargaining chips between parties. These common causes must not be obscured by the fog of political rhetoric. Doug’s heart has always impelled him towards public service. He cares about justice and progress for you and your family, and he’s in the Senate to return dignity to the citizens of Alabama.</p>

<p>Doug’s partner in all things is his wife Louise, who was raised in Cullman, Alabama. Their daughter Courtney, a graduate of Birmingham Southern College, completed her PhD at the University of Alabama and is married to Birmingham attorney Rip Andrews. Their son Carson is a graduate of the University of Georgia and Colorado State. He currently works at the Birmingham Zoo. Their youngest son Christopher is a student at the University of Alabama. Doug’s parents, Gordon and Gloria Jones, live in Birmingham, and his sister Terrie Savage and her husband Scott live in Hartselle.</p>
