          <h2>Gary Peters</h2>
          <p>Sworn into office in 2015, Senator Gary Peters is honored to represent the State of Michigan in the U.S. Senate. Throughout his career in public service, Gary has been a strong, independent voice for Michigan’s families, workers and small businesses. He has focused on uniting our communities by fighting for the things that we all agree on — a stronger economy, good-paying jobs, quality and affordable health care, a secure retirement and a fair chance for everyone to succeed.</p>

<p>In the 116th Congress, Gary serves as Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He also serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the Joint Economic Committee.</p>

<p>In the U.S. Senate, Gary’s top priority is to continue supporting job creation and economic growth to strengthen Michigan small businesses and our middle class. Gary has led and passed legislation that was signed into law under both Democratic and Republican Administrations. He has worked with members of both parties to find commonsense, practical and bipartisan solutions to challenges facing Michigan and our nation. These successful efforts include: increasing protections for the Great Lakes and securing historic funding for restoration efforts; supporting veterans suffering from PTSD or TBI; expanding career and technical education and apprenticeships for workers; and increasing our nation’s security at our borders. That’s why he’s been named one of the most effective and bipartisan Senators, according to non-partisan organizations.</p>

<p>Gary is a product of Michigan schools. He graduated from Rochester High School and went on to Alma College where he earned a B.A. in Political Science. After graduation, while working a full-time job and raising a family, he went on to earn an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Detroit Mercy, a law degree from Wayne State University Law School and an M.A. in Philosophy from Michigan State University with a focus on the ethics of development. Gary was born in Pontiac, Michigan. His father, a World War II veteran, worked as a public school teacher for more than 30 years. His mother – who survived Nazi occupation of France and met Gary’s father while he served in Europe during the war – worked as a nurse’s aide at a local nursing home. She helped organize her workplace and became an SEIU union steward. Growing up, Gary learned the importance of hard work and fairness from his parents. He started his own small business delivering newspapers at age 11. In junior high, he bused tables at a Big Boy restaurant, and in high school and college, he worked at a local retailer. Gary is an Eagle Scout, and a member of the National Eagle Scout Association. In 2019, he received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.</p>

<p>For more than 20 years, Gary worked as an investment advisor, helping families save for their retirement and provide for their children’s college education. However, he always felt the need to serve and give back to his community.</p>

<p>Gary volunteered for the U.S. Navy Reserve at age 34, where he earned a Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist designation and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. After the September 11th terrorist attacks on our country, he volunteered again for drilling status. He also earned a diploma from the College of Naval Command and Staff, U.S. Naval War College.</p>

<p>He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008. Gary began his public service as a Rochester Hills City Councilman in 1991. In 1994, he was elected to the Michigan State Senate, where he had more bills signed into law than any other member of his party. Gary later served as the Michigan State Lottery Commissioner.</p>

<p>Gary and his wife, Colleen, live in Oakland County and have three children: Gary Jr., Madeleine and Alana.</p>
